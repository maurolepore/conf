http://bit.ly/mauro-lepore-about

### Elligibility

> Are there details about your personal background that are relevant to this diversity scholarship that you want us to know?

As an Argentinean, I belong to the underrepresented community of Latin-American R users. 

> Why would you not be able to attend the conference if not selected?

If not selected I wouldn't be able to attend the conference. Although I work in a research organization as an R developer, my work wouldn't found me; and I can't afford to found myself. Unfortunately, my salary is about 30% lower than the median for PhD holder (my education) in USA, and worse, I live in one of the ten most-expensive cities in USA, Washington DC (https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/index/north-america). All I'm abe to invest, are the vacation days I would need to attend.

### Founding required

> Please estimate the costs for you to attend useR!, in Euro. Bus/train/air fare and lodging will be covered for all scholarship recipients, we hope to cover childcare or other additional expenses as weâ€™re able. You can base estimates on whichever lodging suits your logistical requirements (hotel, apartment, airbnb, ...), subject to a modest budget. It is assumed you will travel by economy/standard class transport and use the conference-provided childcare if applicable.

Estimated cost in Euros:

* Bus/train/air fare 1300 Euros
* Lodging 200 Euros
* Childcare (enter zero if not required) 0
* Other (enter zero if not required) 0
* Total 1500 Euros

### Background relevant to useR!

> Tell us a bit about yourself. What are your areas of competence or interest? 

My area of competence and interest lays at the intersection between research and software development. I work as an R-package developer for the Smithsonian's Forest Global Earth Observatory network (<https://forestgeo.si.edu/>). I build R packages and related software infrastructure to help ecologists to analyse the diversity and dynamics of forests around the world.

I first joined the Smithsonian in 2016 and researched how coral reefs in Bocas del Toro, Panama, have changed over the past 7,000 years in response to human impacts. Before that I did a PhD in ecology (2015) at the University of Queensland, Australia, and a bachelors in marine biology (2008) at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

### Reasons for applying.

Tell us why you are interested in attending the useR! 2019 conference.

>  What do you hope to get out of attending?

By attending to useR I hope to get a better understanding of how to advance my career in orded to best support the research and R communities I belong to.

FIXME 
I will attend useR seeking to answer these questions: 

* Who is working in similar problems?
* What gaps remain?
* What is the most important thing I should lean that will maximize my positive impact on the work I do?
* Where
* When? xxx
* Why? xxx

will connect me with people with similar interests and problems. Talking to them will help me to better understand how to move my career forward in orded to best support the research and R communities I belong to.

FIXME

UserR 2019 will connect me with the R-community I most strongly support and rely on. I learn from open source books, webinars, and code by many people will likely attend rstudio::conf() 2019. They are helping me transition from ecologist to R-admin, and strongly influence the knowledge I pass to researchers at ForestGEO (http://www.forestgeo.si.edu).

Since early 2017, I have been developing fgeo (https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/): A collection of R packages for the analysis of forest dynamics. Because fgeo is inspired in the tidyverse, rstudio::conf() will provide an excellent environment to discuss fgeo and think of ways to improve it.

In the future, RStudio's community should continue to influence my work and the knowledge I transfer to others. Part of my role at ForestGEO is to help researchers improve their R-skills. I am teaching them workflows including RStudio projects and the tidyverse. At rstudio::conf() 2019 I will update my understanding of current best practices.

### Potential contribution.

How will you use your participation to benefit other members of the R community and/or your local community after the conference? (Or even during the conference?)

FIXME

I will help others by taking what I learn at rstudio::conf() 2019 and sharing it with the communities I reach. In my role of R-admin, I reach researchers from ForestGEO (a network of scientists studying forests in 27 countries). Informally I reach researchers from the Smithsonian Institution, via Carpentries workshops and by-monthly meetups; and a diverse group of R users from R-Ladies DC and from rOpenSci's unconf2018. These are some examples of how I am already helping others:
