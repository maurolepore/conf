http://bit.ly/mauro-lepore-about

### Elligibility

> Are there details about your personal background that are relevant to this diversity scholarship that you want us to know?

As an Argentinean, I belong to the underrepresented community of Latin-American R users. 

> Why would you not be able to attend the conference if not selected?

If not selected I wouldn't be able to attend the conference. My job has no funds for my professional development, and I can't afford to found myself: My salary is 30% lower than the median for PhD holder (my education) in USA, and I live in one of the ten most-expensive cities in USA, Washington DC (https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/index/north-america). All I'm abe to invest, are the vacation days I would need to attend.

### Founding required

> Please estimate the costs for you to attend useR!, in Euro. Bus/train/air fare and lodging will be covered for all scholarship recipients, we hope to cover childcare or other additional expenses as weâ€™re able. You can base estimates on whichever lodging suits your logistical requirements (hotel, apartment, airbnb, ...), subject to a modest budget. It is assumed you will travel by economy/standard class transport and use the conference-provided childcare if applicable.

Estimated cost in Euros:

* Bus/train/air fare 1300 Euros
* Lodging 200 Euros
* Childcare (enter zero if not required) 0
* Other (enter zero if not required) 0
* Total 1500 Euros

### Background relevant to useR!

> Tell us a bit about yourself ...

> ... What are your areas of competence or interest? 

My area of competence and interest lays at the intersection between research and software development. I work as an R-package developer for the Forest Global Earth Observatory network (<https://forestgeo.si.edu/>). I build R packages and related software infrastructure to help ecologists to analyse the diversity and dynamics of forests around the world. I am based at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC (USA).

I first joined the Smithsonian in 2016 and researched how coral reefs from Panama have changed over the past 7,000 years in response to human impacts. Before that I did a PhD in ecology (2015) at the University of Queensland, Australia, and a bachelors in marine biology (2008) at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

> ... Provide links to any of your projects that we should know about/other evidence of your involvement in the R community.

These links show some of my contributions to the R community (more at <http://bit.ly/mauro-lepore-about>):

* R-package on CRAN: <https://maurolepore.github.io/tor/>
* A meta-package inspired by the tidyverse: <https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo>

### Reasons for applying

> Tell us why you are interested in attending the useR! 2019 conference. What do you hope to get out of attending?

By attending the useR 2019 conference I hope to better understand how to advance my career in order to maximize the positive impact of my work on the research and R communities I support. The useR conference would help me to answer these questions:

* Who is working in similar problems that I could collaborate with so that we move towards our shared goals better and faster?

* What useful tools are clearly missing that I could build or contribute to (e.g. tutorials, packages)?

* How could I redirect my effort in order to most quickly remove whatever barriers are stopping me and others from reaching our goals?

* Where can I find mentors willing to guide my next professional steps?

### Potential contribution.

> How will you use your participation to benefit other members of the R community ...

If "participation" in useR includes this application, I hope to already be helping other members of the R community. This and other scholarship applications are now published at <https://maurolepore.github.io/confs/>. I hope this will motivate and help others with their own applications.

During useR I hope to help others by asking them about their interests and challenges, and then discussing if and how we could benefit from working together. I would attend useR with a very curious mindset. I aim for continuous improvement so I am open to new career challenges.

> ... and/or your local community after the conference? (Or even during the conference?)

After the conference I hope to benefit other members of the R community by sharing what I will have learned. Often I have helped my "closest" ("local + remote") R community by pointing them to the resources they need to solve their problem; and the way I learn about those resources is, to a large extent, by attending meetings such as useR.

Concretely, my "closest" R community is represented by these organizations:

* ForestGEO: "[We are] a global network of scientists and forest research sites dedicated to advancing long-term study of the world's forests" (<https://forestgeo.si.edu/>). I work for ForestGEO as an R developer and advocate.

* rOpenSci: "We build software with a community of users and developers, and educate scientists about transparent research practices" (<https://ropensci.org/>). I ask and answer questions on rOpenSci's slack workspace.

* R-Ladies: "[We are] an organization to promote gender diversity in the R community" (<https://rladies.org/>). I often attend R-Ladies meetups -- particularly in Washington DC -- and strongly support diversity in general.

* The Carpentries: "We teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide" (<https://carpentries.org/>). I teach and help teach Carpentries' workshops.
