### Personal details

<http://bit.ly/mauro-lepore-about>

### Eligibility

> Are there details about your personal background that are relevant to this diversity scholarship that you want us to know? Why would you not be able to attend the conference if not selected?

I belong to the underrepresented community of Latin-American R users. My job can't found me, and I'm unable to found myself (I earn a relatively low salary and live in an extremely expensive city).

### Background relevant to useR!

> Tell us a bit about yourself What are your areas of competence or interest? Provide links to any of your projects that we should know about/other evidence of your involvement in the R community.

My area of competence and interest lays at the intersection between research and software development. My job is to build R packages and software-infrastructure to help ecologists to analyse the diversity and dynamics of forests around the world.

### Reasons for applying

> Tell us why you are interested in attending the useR! 2019 conference. What do you hope to get out of attending?

In only a few days, useR would expose me to a number and diversity of people and ideas greater than ever before. That would enrich my network, improve my ideas, and amplify the positive impact of my work on the research and R communities I support.

### Potential contribution.

> How will you use your participation to benefit other members of the R community and/or your local community after the conference? (Or even during the conference?)

* I hope to motivate and help others by sharing this and other scholarship applications (see <https://maurolepore.github.io/confs/>).

* I hope to identify and collaborate with people with similar interests and challenges.

* I will help people solve their problems more efficiently by sharing what learn with my "closest" ("local + remote") R community including:

* ForestGEO <https://forestgeo.si.edu/>
* rOpenSci <https://ropensci.org/>
* R-Ladies <https://ropensci.org/>
