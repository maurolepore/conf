### Elligibility

> Are there details about your personal background that are relevant to this diversity scholarship that you want us to know?

As an Argentinean, I belong to the underrepresented community of Latin-American R users. 

> Why would you not be able to attend the conference if not selected?

If not selected I wouldn't be able to attend the conference. Although I work in a research organization as an R developer, my work wouldn't found me; and I can't afford to found myself. Unfortunately, my salary is about 30% lower than the median for PhD holder (my education) in USA, and worse, I live in one of the ten most-expensive cities in USA, Washington DC (https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/index/north-america). All I'm abe to invest, are the vacation days I would need to attend.

### Founding required

> Please estimate the costs for you to attend useR!, in Euro. Bus/train/air fare and lodging will be covered for all scholarship recipients, we hope to cover childcare or other additional expenses as weâ€™re able. You can base estimates on whichever lodging suits your logistical requirements (hotel, apartment, airbnb, ...), subject to a modest budget. It is assumed you will travel by economy/standard class transport and use the conference-provided childcare if applicable.

Estimated cost in Euros:

* Bus/train/air fare 1300 Euros
* Lodging 200 Euros
* Childcare (enter zero if not required) 0
* Other (enter zero if not required) 0
* Total 1500 Euros

### Background relevant to useR!

> Tell us a bit about yourself. What are your areas of competence or interest? 

My area of competence and interest lays at the intersection between research and software development. I work as an R-package developer for the Smithsonian's Forest Global Earth Observatory network (<https://forestgeo.si.edu/>). I build R packages and related software infrastructure to help ecologists to analyse the diversity and dynamics of forests around the world.

I first joined the Smithsonian in 2016 and researched how coral reefs in Bocas del Toro, Panama, have changed over the past 7,000 years in response to human impacts. Before that I did a PhD in ecology (2015) at the University of Queensland, Australia, and a bachelors in marine biology (2008) at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

### Reasons for applying

Tell us why you are interested in attending the useR! 2019 conference.

>  What do you hope to get out of attending?

UseR would help me to better understand how move my career forwards. My goal is to reach a sustainable professional-growth-rate, and maximize the positive impact of my work on the research and R communities I belong to. More concretely, useR should help me to answer these and similar questions:

* Who is working in similar problems that I could collaborate with so that we move towards our shared goals better and faster?

* What useful tools are clearly missing that I could build or contribute to (e.g. tutorials, packages)?

* How could I redirect my effort in order to most quickly remove whatever barriers are stopping me and others from reaching our goals?

* Why some of my contributions have not had the impact I had expected?

* Where can I find mentors willing to guide my next professional steps?

* When are they going to serve delicious French cheese or pastries? :-)

### Potential contribution.

> How will you use your participation to benefit other members of the R community

I hope my participation in useR helps others even before the conference -- that is, if "participation" includes this very application. To help other members of the R community I have published this and other scholarship applications at <https://maurolepore.github.io/confs/>. There, I also point readers to the outcome of my applications and share my experiences at the events.

During useR I hope to help other participants by asking them questions about what their interests and challenges are, and by discussing if and how I could be support them. I would attend useR with a very curious mindset as I am trying to identify my next career challenge and the direction of my next professional development step.

> ... and/or your local community after the conference? (Or even during the conference?)

After the conference I hope to benefit other members of the R community by sharing what I learn at useR 2019. Often I can help my "closest" ("local + remote") R community by pointing them to the resources they need to solve their problem. And I learn about those resources largely by attending to R meetings similar to useR (e.g. rstudio::conf() 2019 and rOpenSci's runconf 2018; details at <https://maurolepore.github.io/>).

Concretely, my "closest" R community is represented by these organizations:

* ForestGEO: "A global network of scientists and forest research sites dedicated to advancing long-term study of the world's forests" (<https://forestgeo.si.edu/>). Based at the Smithsonian Institution (Washington DC, USA), I work for ForestGEO as an R developer and advocate.

* The Carpentries: "We teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide" (<https://carpentries.org/>). I teach and help teach their workshops.

* rOpenSci: "We build software with a community of users and developers, and educate scientists about transparent research practices" (<https://ropensci.org/>). I ask and answer questions in their online work-space on slack.

* R-Ladies: "An organization to promote gender diversity in the R community" (<https://rladies.org/>). I often attend R-Ladies meetups, particularly in Washington DC.
