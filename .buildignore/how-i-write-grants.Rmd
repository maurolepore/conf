```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

What works well for me is to read the application form carefully, and to start writing long before the deadline. I pay great attention to statements like "We want to fund people who will have a multiplier effect in their communities". I ignore statements like "We estimate this form will take you 30 minutes to complete".  I usually invest 1-2 hours each day for a week. I write, think, rewrite, and repeat until I run out of energy or time.
