<p>I am an ecologist turned software developer and data science trainer and consultant (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauro-lepore/" class="uri">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauro-lepore/</a>). My mission is to help scientists work openly and collaboratively.</p>
<p>At the event I would like to share my experience teaching and building software infrastructure to help researchers work in a way that is more open, reproducible, and fun. I have already helped a few research groups globally, but with your help we could build a system that scales up well and has a massive positive impact on open science.</p>
<p>I started using R over five years ago, during my PhD (UQ, Australia) and continued during my postdoc (Smithsonian; Panama). Since 2017 I build R packages for a global network of forest ecologists (Smithsonian, USA; <a href="https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/" class="uri">https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/</a>). Technologies I use daily include R, RStudio, Git, GitHub, and TravisCI. I am also a data science trainer for The Carpentries (<a href="https://carpentries.org/" class="uri">https://carpentries.org/</a>), and a freelance consultant for ixpantia (<a href="https://ixpantia.com" class="uri">https://ixpantia.com</a>).</p>
<p>I regularly contribute to open software and reproducible research (<a href="https://maurolepore.github.io" class="uri">https://maurolepore.github.io</a>). For example, I am an instructor for The Carpentries (<a href="https://carpentries.org/instructors/" class="uri">https://carpentries.org/instructors/</a>), and a peer-reviewer of rOpenSci packages (<a href="http://bit.ly/mauro-ropensci-review-gitignore" class="uri">http://bit.ly/mauro-ropensci-review-gitignore</a>). Also, I have been invited to attend other open science meetings (<a href="https://unconf18.ropensci.org/#participants" class="uri">https://unconf18.ropensci.org/#participants</a>, and <a href="https://chirunconf.github.io/#team" class="uri">https://chirunconf.github.io/#team</a>), and to speak at a DataLatam webinar (<a href="http://youtu.be/SVzyWV1Iep8" class="uri">http://youtu.be/SVzyWV1Iep8</a>).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I am interested in participating in the Innovation Sprint because with the help of other motivated attendees we could build a scalable system for on-boarding researchers into data science.</p>
<p>Many of us (attendees) already have some experience on-boarding fellow researchers who want to work in a more open, collaborative, and reproducible way. Many attempts may have failed but some surely worked. Collectively, we should have enough success stories to identify what works and why, then focus on building a system to replicate those “bright spots” at scale. Two models that we could use for inspiration are rOpenSci and The Carpentries.</p>

<p>Please share the story of an idea you have prototyped or brought to fruition before, what you contributed and learned, and why you are proud of this. The idea does not need to relate to the scope of this event, but we are particularly interested in contributions to any open (source or science) projects!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In less than two years I went from building my first R package to building a package-ecosystem for a global network of forest ecologists (<a href="https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/" class="uri">https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/</a>). Along the way, I met some of the most productive and friendly R developers worldwide, and joined multiple meetups and organizations supporting open science. Inspired, I learned the best practices in software development with R. I am proud that I am now able to give back to the open software/data community by teaching others what I now know.</p>

<p>Smart, motivated researchers shouldn’t struggle to join the open science revolution. At the Sprint I hope to develop a scalable system to on-board researchers who want to work in a more transparent, reproducible, and collaborative way. Two models for inspiration include rOpenSci (<a href="https://ropensci.org" class="uri">https://ropensci.org</a>) and The Carpentries (<a href="https://carpentries.org/" class="uri">https://carpentries.org/</a>).</p>
<p>The Sprint should gather researchers representing a wide range of fields and computational ability. This is an excellent opportunity to prototype and test a kit with the minimal learning resources and tools for new open scientists to build their own skills and software infrastructure.</p>
<p>The system may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast, friendly support from previously on-boarded researchers (e.g. via slack).</li>
<li>A simple way to incorporate feedback (e.g. via Google forms or GitHub issues).</li>
<li>Tutorials of multiple kinds (e.g. interactive, text, video).</li>
<li>A checkout process to credit newly on-boarded folks (e.g. certificate, badge).</li>
<li>A strong focus on community, diversity, respect, continuous learning.</li>
<li>A code of conduct.</li>
<li>A way to make people feel safe asking questions.</li>
<li>A way to make people feel good about answering questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Useful technologies and learning resources are already available, but they are so many, scattered, and full of jargon that most researchers end up frustrated and paralyzed.</p>
<p>As a data science instructor, developer and consultant, time and again I have seen researchers give up during the steep initial learning curve, before they experience the payoff. It is not them who fail; the failure is of the system that filters who joins the open science club. A lot of people want to join but the club is too exclusive. Let’s make open science a popular club. Can we make open science the path of least resistance and the most fun?</p>
