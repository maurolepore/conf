I regularly contribute to open software and reproducible research (https://maurolepore.github.io). For example, I am an instructor for The Carpentries (https://carpentries.org/instructors/), and a peer-reviewer of rOpenSci packages (http://bit.ly/mauro-ropensci-review-gitignore). Also, I have been invited to attend other open science meetings (https://unconf18.ropensci.org/#participants, and https://chirunconf.github.io/#team), and to speak at a DataLatam webinar (http://youtu.be/SVzyWV1Iep8).
