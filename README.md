# meeting.applications

<!-- badges: start -->

This repo contains applications to meetings, e.g. (un)conferences. It targets future me but it  may help you to write your own applications.

Although it is not useful as an R package, it's structured as one so I can use convenient package-development tools (e.g. `usethis::browse_github()`, `pkgdown::use_article()`).
