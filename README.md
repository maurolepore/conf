# meeting.applications

<!-- badges: start -->

This repo contains applications to meetings, e.g. (un)conferences. It targets future me but it  may help you to write your own applications.

Although it is not useful as an R package, it's structured as one so I can use convenient package-development tools such as `usethis::browse_github()`, `pkgdown::use_article()`, and `spelling::spell_check_package()`.

Would you like more examples of how to benefit from package-development tools in non R-package projects? Watch [A guide to modern reproducible data science with R, by Karthik Ram](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/a-guide-to-modern-reproducible-data-science-with-r).
