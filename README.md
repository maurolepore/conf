Writing a strong grant-applications to attend (un)conferences is a lot of work. Although much of that effort can help write future applications, I didn't have a systematic way to collect and share my application materials and experiences. Here I collect my applications to R (un)conferences and thoughts about my experiences. 

* To see what applications where successful see my _Most recent grants and sponsors_ at <https://maurolepore.github.io/>.

#### Curious to know if this is a blog, a website, or an R package?

It is all three. As in a blog and website, this product is meant to be read. Also, it is internally structured as an R package because I love to use convenient package-development tools such as `usethis::browse_github()`, `pkgdown::use_article()`, and `spelling::spell_check_package()`. But if you run `install_github("maurolepore/confs")` you achieve nothing useful.
