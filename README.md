Writing a strong grant-applications to attend (un)conferences is a lot of work. Although much of that effort can help write future applications, I didn't have a systematic way to collect and share my application materials and experiences. Here I collect my applications to R (un)conferences and thoughts about my experiences.

Although this is a kind of blog, it's structured as an R package so I can use convenient package-development tools such as `usethis::browse_github()`, `pkgdown::use_article()`, and `spelling::spell_check_package()`.
